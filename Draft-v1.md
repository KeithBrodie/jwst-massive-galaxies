# Accelerated Structure Formation from Horizon Thermodynamics: Resolving the JWST Early Massive Galaxy Anomaly

**K. Brodie (2026)**

---

## Abstract

The James Webb Space Telescope has revealed galaxies with stellar masses of $10^9$--$10^{10}\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z > 10$, within 400 Myr of the Big Bang. In standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the free-fall timescale of protogalactic baryonic clouds at these epochs exceeds the age of the universe, and the required dark matter halos represent $>10\sigma$ fluctuations in the primordial density field. We show that these galaxies form naturally --- with no free parameters --- in the thermodynamic spacetime framework of Jacobson (1995) when the Hubble horizon is imposed as a finite outer boundary on the vacuum mode spectrum. This boundary condition modifies the inertial response of matter at accelerations below $a_0(z) = cH(z)$, the same mechanism that produces flat galaxy rotation curves at $z = 0$ [Brodie 2026a]. Because $H(z)$ is much larger at early times --- $a_0(z{=}12) \approx 26\,a_0(z{=}0)$ --- the modification extends to all protogalactic scales. Gravitational accelerations in collapsing clouds ($g \sim 10^{-12}$ m/s$^2$) fall 3--4 orders of magnitude below $a_0(z)$, placing them deeply in the modified regime. The resulting collapse timescales are $\sim$5--18 Myr, compared to $>$300 Myr in the standard framework --- more than sufficient to assemble the observed galaxies within the available cosmic time. No dark matter, no modified star formation efficiency, and no new free parameters are required.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Anomaly

The first deep-field observations from JWST revealed a population of galaxy candidates at $z > 10$ that are far too massive and morphologically mature to exist under the standard $\Lambda$CDM structure formation timeline [1--4]. Spectroscopic confirmation campaigns have since established galaxies at $z = 10.6$ [5], $z = 11.4$ [6], $z = 13.2$ [7], and $z = 14.2$ [8], with stellar masses ranging from $10^{7.8}$ to $10^{10}\,M_\odot$.

Boylan-Kolchin [9] quantified the tension: even assuming 100\% star formation efficiency (a physical impossibility --- it requires converting every available baryon into stars with no gas ejection, no remaining gas, and no feedback losses), several JWST candidates exceed the maximum stellar mass permitted by the $\Lambda$CDM halo mass function at their observed redshifts. The implied number densities of massive galaxies at $z > 10$ exceed $\Lambda$CDM predictions by factors of $\sim$3--100 [10--12].

Subsequent work has reduced the most extreme mass estimates through identification of AGN contamination [13], bursty star formation histories [14,15], and nebular emission corrections [16]. These revisions lower individual stellar masses by factors of 3--10 but do not eliminate the population-level tension: the UV luminosity function at $z > 12$ remains systematically above $\Lambda$CDM predictions [10,17], and the spectroscopically confirmed population continues to grow.

### 1.2 The Timescale Problem

The anomaly is most sharply stated as a timescale problem. At $z = 12$, the age of the universe is 367 Myr. The first stars form after $z \sim 30$ ($t \sim 100$ Myr), leaving approximately 270 Myr for galaxy assembly. In $\Lambda$CDM, the standard free-fall time for a protogalactic baryonic cloud at 5$\times$ the mean density is:

$$t_{\rm ff} = \sqrt{\frac{3\pi}{32\,G\,\rho}} \approx 300\text{--}400\ {\rm Myr} \quad (z \sim 12)$$

This exceeds the available cosmic time. Even a single gravitational collapse cannot be completed, let alone the multiple generations of collapse, star formation, and feedback required to build a galaxy with $M_\star \sim 10^9\,M_\odot$.

In the standard hierarchical picture, the additional bottleneck is the rarity of sufficiently massive dark matter halos. A halo of $10^{11}\,M_\odot$ at $z = 12$ corresponds to a $\sim$9$\sigma$ fluctuation in the primordial density field, with an expected number density of effectively zero in the observable universe.

### 1.3 Existing Proposals

Several mechanisms have been proposed to alleviate the tension within or near the standard framework:

- **Enhanced star formation efficiency** at high $z$, including "feedback-free starbursts" in which gas converts to stars before feedback can regulate the process [18]. This addresses the mass budget but not the timescale or halo abundance problems.

- **Early dark energy** models can boost the high-$z$ halo mass function, but are constrained by CMB and BAO observations [19].

- **MOND/Milgromian cosmology**: Haslbauer et al. [20] showed that MOND predicts more massive galaxies at early times than $\Lambda$CDM, because the enhanced effective gravity accelerates structure formation. However, MOND's critical acceleration $a_0 = 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$ is an empirical constant with no first-principles derivation. Its extension to cosmological settings requires additional assumptions about its redshift dependence.

### 1.4 This Work

We show that the JWST anomaly is resolved naturally by the thermodynamic spacetime framework [21] when the finite Hubble horizon is imposed as a boundary condition on the vacuum mode spectrum. This framework, developed in [Brodie 2026a], derives a modification to the inertial mass of matter at accelerations below

$$a_0(z) = c\,H(z) \tag{1}$$

from Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of Einstein's equations [21], with no free parameters. The critical acceleration $a_0$ is not inserted by hand (as in MOND) but emerges from the geometry: it is the acceleration at which an observer's Rindler horizon reaches the Hubble horizon.

Because $H(z)$ was much larger in the early universe --- $H(z{=}12)/H_0 \approx 26$ --- the inertia modification extends to much higher accelerations at early times. All protogalactic dynamics at $z > 10$ fall deeply within the modified regime, and gravitational collapse proceeds on timescales of $\sim$5--20 Myr rather than hundreds of Myr. The "impossible" early massive galaxies are impossible only under the assumption that inertia is constant.

## 2. Framework

We summarize the relevant results from [Brodie 2026a]; the reader is referred there for the full derivation.

### 2.1 Jacobson's Thermodynamic Spacetime

Jacobson [21] showed that Einstein's field equations emerge from the first law of thermodynamics ($\delta Q = T\,dS$) applied to local Rindler horizons, provided the entropy satisfies the Bekenstein-Hawking area law $S = k_B A / (4\ell_P^2)$. This derivation assumes local equilibrium: that every horizon patch has the full entropy, with all vacuum modes contributing.

### 2.2 The Boundary Modification

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy counts vacuum modes from the UV cutoff (Planck scale) to effectively infinite wavelength. In a universe with a finite Hubble horizon at $R_H = c/H$, modes with wavelength $\lambda > \Theta = 2R_H$ cannot exist. When the Rindler horizon distance $d_R = c^2/a$ of an accelerating observer approaches $R_H$, a significant fraction of modes is excluded, modifying the entropy:

$$S' = S \times \left[1 - \left(\frac{2c^2}{a\,\Theta}\right)^2\right] \tag{2}$$

Propagating this through Jacobson's $\delta Q = T\,dS'$ yields, in the non-relativistic weak-field limit, a modified inertial mass:

$$m_i(a) = m_g \left[1 - \left(\frac{a_0}{a}\right)^2\right], \qquad a_0 \equiv \frac{2c^2}{\Theta} = cH \tag{3}$$

This is McCulloch's Quantized Inertia formula [22], here derived from Jacobson's established framework rather than postulated.

### 2.3 The Self-Consistent Equation of Motion

The modified equation of motion $F = m_i(a)\,a$ with gravitational force $F = m_g\,g$ gives:

$$a^2 - g\,a - a_0^2 = 0 \tag{4}$$

with the physical solution:

$$a = \frac{g + \sqrt{g^2 + 4\,a_0^2}}{2} \tag{5}$$

This has the correct limits:
- **High acceleration** ($g \gg a_0$): $a \to g$ (standard Newtonian dynamics)
- **Low acceleration** ($g \ll a_0$): $a \to a_0$ (acceleration floor, modified regime)
- **Transition** at $g \sim a_0 = cH$

At $z = 0$, $a_0 = cH_0 \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$, matching the MOND acceleration scale. This explains galaxy rotation curves without dark matter [Brodie 2026a; 23].

### 2.4 Cosmological Evolution

The Hubble parameter evolves as:

$$H(z) = H_0\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_r(1+z)^4 + \Omega_\Lambda} \tag{6}$$

Therefore $a_0(z) = cH(z)$ increases with redshift. Using Planck 2018 parameters ($H_0 = 67.4$ km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m = 0.315$, $\Omega_r = 9.1 \times 10^{-5}$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.685$):

| $z$ | $H(z)/H_0$ | $a_0(z)$ [m/s$^2$] | Enhancement |
|----:|:----------:|:-------------------:|:-----------:|
| 0 | 1.0 | $6.6 \times 10^{-10}$ | 1$\times$ |
| 6 | 10.4 | $6.8 \times 10^{-9}$ | 10$\times$ |
| 10 | 20.5 | $1.3 \times 10^{-8}$ | 21$\times$ |
| 12 | 26.4 | $1.7 \times 10^{-8}$ | **26$\times$** |
| 14 | 32.7 | $2.1 \times 10^{-8}$ | 33$\times$ |
| 20 | 54.2 | $3.6 \times 10^{-8}$ | 55$\times$ |

**Table 1.** Critical acceleration $a_0(z) = cH(z)$ at key redshifts.

A critical consequence: at $z = 0$, the modification only affects the outermost regions of galaxies where $g < 6.6 \times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$. At $z = 12$, it affects all regions where $g < 1.7 \times 10^{-8}$ m/s$^2$ --- encompassing the entirety of protogalactic collapse dynamics.

We emphasize that the Friedmann equation governing the background expansion is unchanged. The modification applies to the inertial response of test masses to gravitational forces, not to the relation between stress-energy and spacetime geometry. The cosmic timeline remains standard: $t(z{=}12) = 367$ Myr.

## 3. Application to JWST Galaxies

### 3.1 Protogalactic Dynamics in the Modified Regime

Consider a protogalactic baryonic cloud of mass $M_b$ at redshift $z$, with density $\rho = \delta \times \rho_{\rm mean}(z)$ at turnaround ($\delta \sim 5$). The cloud radius is:

$$R = \left(\frac{3\,M_b}{4\pi\,\rho}\right)^{1/3} \tag{7}$$

and the Newtonian gravitational acceleration at the cloud edge is:

$$g = \frac{G\,M_b}{R^2} \tag{8}$$

For the JWST galaxies, we take the observed stellar mass $M_\star$, assume a star formation efficiency of 10\%, and compute the progenitor cloud mass $M_b = M_\star / 0.1$. The results are shown in Table 2.

| Galaxy | $z$ | $\log M_\star$ | $g$ [m/s$^2$] | $a_0(z)$ [m/s$^2$] | $g/a_0$ |
|--------|----:|:-----:|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:-------:|
| JADES-GS-z14-0 | 14.2 | 8.7 | $4.9 \times 10^{-12}$ | $2.2 \times 10^{-8}$ | $2.2 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| JADES-GS-z13-0 | 13.2 | 8.1 | $2.7 \times 10^{-12}$ | $2.0 \times 10^{-8}$ | $1.4 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| JADES-GS-z12-0 | 12.6 | 7.8 | $2.0 \times 10^{-12}$ | $1.9 \times 10^{-8}$ | $1.1 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| Maisie's Galaxy | 11.4 | 8.5 | $2.8 \times 10^{-12}$ | $1.6 \times 10^{-8}$ | $1.7 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| GN-z11 | 10.6 | 9.0 | $3.6 \times 10^{-12}$ | $1.5 \times 10^{-8}$ | $2.5 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| CEERS-1 | 8.9 | 9.5 | $3.8 \times 10^{-12}$ | $1.2 \times 10^{-8}$ | $3.3 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| CEERS-2 | 7.9 | 9.8 | $3.9 \times 10^{-12}$ | $9.8 \times 10^{-9}$ | $4.0 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| CEERS-3 | 7.5 | 10.0 | $4.1 \times 10^{-12}$ | $9.1 \times 10^{-9}$ | $4.5 \times 10^{-4}$ |

**Table 2.** Gravitational accelerations in progenitor clouds of observed JWST galaxies. In all cases $g/a_0 \sim 10^{-4}$: every object is deeply in the modified inertia regime.

The ratio $g/a_0 \sim 10^{-4}$ across all objects means we are firmly in the deep-QI limit where $g \ll a_0$, and the self-consistent acceleration (Eq. 5) is approximately $a \approx a_0(z)$. The enhancement factor is:

$$\eta \equiv \frac{a}{g} \approx \frac{a_0(z)}{g} \sim 2000\text{--}9000 \tag{9}$$

### 3.2 Modified Collapse Timescale

The standard free-fall time for a uniform sphere of density $\rho$ is:

$$t_{\rm ff} = \sqrt{\frac{3\pi}{32\,G\,\rho}} \tag{10}$$

In the modified regime, the effective acceleration is enhanced by factor $\eta$. The collapse timescale can be estimated by two methods that bracket the true value:

**Lower bound** (constant-acceleration approximation): In the deep-QI limit, the cloud accelerates at approximately $a_0(z)$ throughout the early collapse phase:

$$t_{\rm lower} = \sqrt{\frac{2R}{a_0(z)}} \tag{11}$$

**Upper bound** ($\sqrt{\eta}$ scaling): The free-fall time scales inversely with the square root of the effective acceleration:

$$t_{\rm upper} = \frac{t_{\rm ff}}{\sqrt{\eta}} \tag{12}$$

We adopt the geometric mean $t_{\rm mod} = \sqrt{t_{\rm lower} \times t_{\rm upper}}$ as our estimate. The results are shown in Table 3.

| Galaxy | $z$ | $t_{\rm avail}$ [Myr] | $t_{\rm ff}$ (standard) [Myr] | $t_{\rm mod}$ (modified) [Myr] | $N_{\rm collapse}$ |
|--------|----:|:------:|:----:|:----:|:---:|
| JADES-GS-z14-0 | 14.2 | 190 | 306 | **5.2** | 37 |
| JADES-GS-z13-0 | 13.2 | 222 | 339 | **4.5** | 50 |
| JADES-GS-z12-0 | 12.6 | 243 | 362 | **4.2** | 58 |
| Maisie's Galaxy | 11.4 | 294 | 416 | **6.2** | 48 |
| GN-z11 | 10.6 | 335 | 460 | **8.1** | 41 |
| CEERS-1 | 8.9 | 452 | 583 | **12.0** | 38 |
| CEERS-2 | 7.9 | 548 | 684 | **15.4** | 36 |
| CEERS-3 | 7.5 | 594 | 733 | **17.6** | 34 |

**Table 3.** Collapse timescales for JWST galaxies. $t_{\rm avail}$ is the time from first star formation ($z = 30$) to the observed redshift. $N_{\rm collapse} = t_{\rm avail} / t_{\rm mod}$ is the number of collapse generations that fit within the available time. In the standard framework, not even one free-fall can be completed ($t_{\rm ff} > t_{\rm avail}$ for $z \gtrsim 10$). In the modified framework, 30--60 collapse generations are available.

### 3.3 Formation Feasibility

For JADES-GS-z14-0, the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy ($z = 14.2$, $M_\star \sim 10^{8.7}\,M_\odot$) [8]:

- **Standard**: $t_{\rm ff} = 306$ Myr exceeds the available time of 190 Myr. The galaxy *cannot complete a single gravitational collapse*. Formation is impossible.

- **Modified**: $t_{\rm mod} = 5.2$ Myr. There are 37 collapse timescales available. At 10\% star formation efficiency per collapse, the galaxy can build $M_\star \sim 10^{8.7}\,M_\odot$ in fewer than 10 generations --- easily within the budget.

The result is the same for every object in the sample. The standard framework cannot form these galaxies; the modified framework forms them trivially.

### 3.4 No Dark Matter Required

A further consequence of modified inertia is the elimination of the dark matter halo bottleneck. In $\Lambda$CDM, baryons collapse only after dark matter halos have formed through hierarchical merging. The abundance of halos is exponentially sensitive to the peak height $\nu = \delta_c / (\sigma(M) \cdot D(z))$, which reaches $\nu \sim 9$--12 at $z > 12$ for the required halo masses. At $\nu = 12$, the probability is $\sim e^{-72} \sim 10^{-31}$ --- effectively zero.

In the modified inertia framework, dark matter is unnecessary: flat rotation curves arise from the inertia modification itself [Brodie 2026a; 23]. Baryonic gas collapses directly under its own gravity, enhanced by the reduced inertia. The exponential suppression from the halo mass function is absent, and the relevant question is simply whether the baryonic gas can collapse within the available time. As shown above, it can --- with time to spare.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Comparison with MOND

Haslbauer et al. [20] demonstrated that Milgromian dynamics predicts a higher abundance of massive galaxies at early times than $\Lambda$CDM, qualitatively consistent with JWST observations. Our result is in the same spirit but differs in three important respects:

1. **Derived, not empirical.** MOND introduces $a_0 = 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$ as an empirical constant. In our framework, $a_0 = cH$ emerges from Jacobson's thermodynamic spacetime [21] with a finite Hubble boundary --- no free parameters.

2. **Redshift dependence is built in.** MOND does not specify how $a_0$ evolves with cosmic time; any $z$-dependence must be added by assumption. Our $a_0(z) = cH(z)$ follows directly from the physics: the Hubble horizon shrinks at early times, truncating more modes and producing a larger inertia modification.

3. **Modified inertia, not modified gravity.** MOND modifies the gravitational force law. We modify the inertial response of matter. These are observationally distinguishable [24] and represent different physics. In our framework, the gravitational field equations (Einstein's equations) are unchanged; only the relationship between force and acceleration is modified through the entropy correction.

### 4.2 Comparison with Conventional Explanations

The mainstream proposals --- enhanced star formation efficiency [18], bursty star formation histories [14,15], and AGN contamination corrections [13] --- address the mass estimates of individual objects. They do not address the fundamental timescale problem: at $z > 12$, the standard free-fall time exceeds the age of the universe regardless of how efficiently stars form once collapse occurs.

Our framework resolves the timescale problem directly. Collapse occurs in $\sim$5--18 Myr, and the question of star formation efficiency becomes moot: there is ample time for multiple collapse-and-formation cycles, and even modest efficiencies ($\sim$10\%) produce the observed stellar masses.

### 4.3 CMB Compatibility

The modification to inertia is also active at recombination ($z \sim 1100$), where $a_0(z) \sim 2 \times 10^{-5}$ m/s$^2$ and the gravitational accelerations in CMB-scale perturbations ($g \sim 10^{-12}$ m/s$^2$) are far below $a_0$. This raises the question of whether the modification is compatible with the observed CMB power spectrum.

We note that the modification derived in [Brodie 2026a] applies specifically to the inertial response of matter to gravitational forces, not to electromagnetic interactions. The baryon acoustic oscillations that produce the CMB peaks are driven by radiation pressure (an electromagnetic effect), with gravity providing the driving potential wells. If the inertia modification applies only to the gravitational sector --- as expected from its origin in Jacobson's gravitational thermodynamics --- the pressure-driven oscillation dynamics may be less affected than a naive estimate would suggest.

A definitive answer requires a numerical calculation with a modified Boltzmann code (e.g., CLASS or CAMB incorporating the inertia correction). This is beyond the scope of the present work and is the subject of ongoing investigation. We note, however, that the analogous question arises for any MOND-like theory, and that several authors have explored CMB compatibility in Milgromian frameworks [25,26] with partial success.

### 4.4 Predictions

The framework makes specific, testable predictions:

1. **Mass--redshift relation.** The maximum stellar mass at each redshift is determined by $a_0(z) = cH(z)$ and the available cosmic time. This produces a definite, parameter-free prediction for the envelope of the galaxy population on the mass--redshift plane. Future JWST observations at $z > 15$ should continue to find galaxies above the $\Lambda$CDM limit and below our predicted ceiling.

2. **Scaling with $H(z)$.** The collapse timescale scales as $t_{\rm mod} \propto 1/\sqrt{a_0(z)} \propto 1/\sqrt{H(z)}$. The modification is strongest at the highest redshifts and weakens toward low $z$ as $H$ decreases. This naturally explains why the anomaly is most severe at early times and becomes less pronounced at $z < 6$.

3. **No dark matter halos.** In our framework, massive galaxies at high $z$ form from direct baryonic collapse without prior dark matter halo assembly. Observations probing the mass distribution of high-$z$ galaxies (e.g., through gravitational lensing or dynamics) should find baryon-dominated systems, not the dark-matter-dominated halos predicted by $\Lambda$CDM.

4. **Morphological maturity.** The rapid collapse timescale ($\sim$5--20 Myr) allows time for multiple dynamical relaxation periods before the galaxy is observed. This could explain the unexpectedly mature morphologies (disks, bulges) seen at $z \sim 6$--8 [27,28], which are puzzling in the standard framework where galaxies at these epochs should still be dynamically young.

---

## 5. Conclusion

The JWST "impossible early massive galaxies" are impossible only if inertia is constant. In the thermodynamic spacetime framework, the finite Hubble horizon modifies the vacuum mode spectrum, reducing the effective inertia of matter at accelerations below $a_0(z) = cH(z)$. At $z > 10$, this critical acceleration is 20--50 times larger than at $z = 0$, placing all protogalactic dynamics deeply in the modified regime.

The consequences are dramatic: gravitational collapse timescales drop from hundreds of Myr to $\sim$5--20 Myr, 30--60 collapse generations become available within the cosmic time budget, and the dark matter halo bottleneck is eliminated entirely. Every spectroscopically confirmed JWST galaxy at $z > 7$ forms easily within this framework, with no free parameters and no fine-tuning.

The framework inherits the conceptual solidity of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of Einstein's equations [21] --- the most cited result in quantum gravity --- extended by the simple physical fact that the universe has a finite horizon. The "anomaly" is not anomalous; it is what horizon thermodynamics predicts.
